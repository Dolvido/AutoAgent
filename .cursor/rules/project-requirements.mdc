# AutoCritic: Self-Improving Coding Critique Agent

## system.name
AutoCritic

## system.purpose
AI-powered coding assistant that critiques developer code, learns from user feedback, and adapts its feedback strategies over time. Runs fully offline with local LLMs and vector memory.

---

## feature.input.code_paste
- Accept raw code or Git-style diff as input.
- Supported formats: pasted text, uploaded file (.py, .js, etc.).
- Auto-detect language from file extension or content.

## feature.input.ui
- Web interface with code editor (Monaco or Ace).
- "Critique" button triggers LLM agent evaluation.
- Language toggle (optional).

## feature.agent.langchain
- LangChain Runnable chain or Tool.
- Chain receives input: {code, language}.
- Executes 3 steps: summarize, identify issues, suggest fixes.

## feature.llm.local
- Use Ollama to run Mistral/CodeLLaMA/Gemma locally.
- LLM temperature configurable (0.3 default).
- Return raw and structured critique.

## feature.prompt.template
- Use few-shot prompt format:
  - Summarize the code
  - Identify 2–3 issues (clarity, structure, best practices)
  - Suggest actionable improvements (no rewrites unless requested)

## feature.output.ui_feedback
- Display critique in collapsible cards:
  - Fields: issue, reason, fix suggestion.
- Buttons: Accept | Ignore | Copy Fix | Regenerate.

## feature.feedback.logging
- Log each session:
  - Input code, critique, timestamp.
  - User action (accepted, rejected, ignored).
- Store in JSON or SQLite.

## feature.memory.embedding
- Embed past critique entries (code + feedback).
- Use FAISS or Chroma as vector DB.
- On new input, retrieve top-K similar snippets.
- Inject prior suggestions into prompt context.

## feature.meta_agent.prompt_tuner
- Periodically evaluate feedback logs.
- Score prompts based on accept rate.
- Replace/adjust underperforming prompt chains.

## feature.self_improvement.criteria
- Feedback loop success if:
  - % accepted critiques increases over time.
  - Suggestions become more relevant (lower ignore rate).
- Log tuning history.

## feature.export
- Export critique to Markdown or JSON.
- Optional: Git patch suggestion (future).

## feature.persistence
- Store critiques and logs across sessions.
- Optional: user profile with preferences.

## constraints
- No paid APIs.
- Must run entirely offline.
- No cloud storage or external telemetry.

## tech.stack
- Frontend: Next.js + Tailwind + shadcn/ui + Monaco
- Backend: LangChain + FastAPI (or local Flask server)
- Memory: FAISS/Chroma
- LLM: Ollama + open models
- Storage: JSON or SQLite

## bonus.features
